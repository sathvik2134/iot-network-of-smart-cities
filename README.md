🌐 IoT Network for Smart City

📌 Project Description

The IoT Network for Smart City project demonstrates how Internet of Things (IoT) devices integrated with big data analytics (PySpark) can improve urban living. The system collects, processes, and analyzes simulated IoT sensor data from traffic management and waste collection services, providing insights that can help city authorities make data-driven decisions.

By leveraging real-time IoT data, the project highlights how smart cities can improve mobility, sustainability, and resource utilization.

🎯 Objectives

Build a scalable IoT data processing pipeline using PySpark.

Analyze traffic congestion patterns for better traffic management.

Optimize waste collection efficiency by monitoring bin fill levels.

Provide actionable insights for city planners.

⚙️ How It Works

1. IoT Data Collection – Simulated datasets represent traffic sensors and smart waste bins.


2. Traffic Analysis – Average congestion levels are calculated per location to identify high-traffic areas.


3. Waste Analysis – Bin utilization is measured, and bins with >90% fill levels are flagged as requiring urgent collection.


4. Smart Insights – Critical locations for traffic intervention and waste collection inefficiencies are highlighted.


5. Data Output – Results are saved as CSV files for further reporting and decision-making.
